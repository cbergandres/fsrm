    "What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open source, high-level programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and presently administered by Python Software Foundation. It came from the ABC language that he helped create early on his career.\n",
    "Python is a powerful language that you can use to create games, write GUIs and develop web applications.\n",
    "It is a high-level language. Reading and writing codes in Python is like reading and writing regular English statements. They are not written in machine-readable language and therefore need to be processed before machines can run them.\n",
    "It is an interpreted language which means that everytime a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable code.\n",
    "It is an object-oriented language that allows users to manage and control data structures or objects to create and run programs.  \n",
    "Programming languages are created to satisfy the needs of programmers and users for an effective tool to develop applications that impact lives, lifestyles, economy, and society. They help make lives better by increasing productivity, enhancing communication, and improving efficiency. Languages die and become obsolete when they fail to live up to expectations and are replaced and superseded by languages that are more powerful. Python is a programming language that has stood the test of time and has remained relevant across industries and businesses and among programmers, and individual users. It is a living, thriving, and highly useful language that is highly recommended as a first programming language for those who want to dive into and experience programming.\n",
