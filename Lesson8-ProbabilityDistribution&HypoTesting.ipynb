    "## Review on Probability Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete and Continuous Probability Distributions\n",
    "1. A probability distribution gives the probabilities of all possible outcomes for a random variable\n",
    "2. A discrete distribution has a finite number of possible outcomes\n",
    "3. A continuous distribution has an infinite number of possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Functions\n",
    "1. The number of days next week on which it will rain is a discrete random variable that can take on the values {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}\n",
    "2. The amount of rain that will fall next week is a continuous random variable\n",
    "3. A probability function, p(x), gives the probability that a discrete random variable will take on the value x\n",
    "\t[e.g., p(x) = x / 15 for X = {1,2,3,4,5} → p(3) = 20%]\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cumulative Distribution Function\n",
    "1. A cumulative distribution function (cdf), F(x), gives the probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "2. For the probability function: p(x) = x / 15 for X = {1,2,3,4,5}\n",
    "                                     F(3) = 1 / 15 + 2 / 15 + 3 / 15 = 6 / 15 = 40%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CDF for a Continuous Distribution!\n",
    "Example: The %ROE, x, for a firm is defined over (–20, +30) and has a CDF of F(x) = (x + 20) / 50.  What is the probability that the ROE will be positive and less than or equal to 15?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prob (0 ≤ x < 15) = F(15) – F(0)\n",
    "    Prob (x ≤ 15) = F(15) = (15 + 20) / 50 = 70%\n",
    "    Prob (x ≤ 0) = F(0) = 20 / 50 = 40%\n",
    "    70 – 40 = 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Uniform\n",
    "A discrete uniform distribution has a finite number of possible outcomes, all of which are equally likely \n",
    "\n",
    "\tFor example, p(x) = 0.2 for X = {1,2,3,4,5}\n",
    "\tp(2) = 20%  \n",
    "\tF(3) = 60%  \n",
    "\tProb(2  ≤  X  ≤  4) = 60%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binomial Random Variable\n",
    "The probability of exactly x successes in n trials, given just two possible outcomes (success and failure)\n",
    "Probability of success on each trial (p) is constant, and trials are independent\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial – Example\n",
    "What is the probability of drawing exactly two white marbles from a bowl of white and black marbles in six tries if the probability of selecting white is 0.4 each time? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributed evenly over an interval\n",
    "Example: Random variable is continuous uniform over the interval 2 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X < 2) = 0     P(X > 10) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "P(3 ≤ X ≤ 5) = (5 – 3) / (10 – 2) = 2 / 8 = 25%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Normal Distribution\n",
    "1. Completely described by mean and variance\n",
    "2. Symmetric about the mean (skewness = 0)\n",
    "3. Kurtosis (a measure of peakedness) = 3\n",
    "4. Linear combination of normally distributed random variables is also normally distributed\n",
    "5. Probabilities decrease further from the mean, but the tails go on forever\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate normal: more than one random variable, need means, variances, and correlation coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Interval: Normal Distribution\n",
    "Confidence interval: A range of values around an expected outcome. A random variable is expected to be in this range a certain percentage of the time.\n"
